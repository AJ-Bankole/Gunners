# Gunners

**Gunners** is a website dedicated to Arsenal Football Club. It is essentially a hub for the r/gunners [subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/gunners).


## UX

As I mentioned, I designed this site to be a hub for r/gunners. 

Reddit can be confusing if you're not a regular user- it can be hard to find the type of content that interests you. I've recommended certain subreddits to my friends, but they have struggled with the navigation of the website. 

The goal of this project is to bridge the gap between the subreddit's community and the wider *Arsenal-supporting* community by showcasing some of it's top content and providing links to certain parts of reddit which user's may be interested in.

This website isn't exclusively a hub for r/gunners however, as there are a number of other pages which provide information about various aspects around the club.


### User Stories:

* As an Arsenal fan, I want to have everything I need to know about the club all in the same place.
* I'd like a browser homepage that relates to my interest in Arsenal and gives me a shortcut to useful info such as upcoming fixtures.
* I'm not necessarily a reddit user, however I enjoy some content especially in regards to Arsenal; I'd like to have a streamlined version of r/gunners with which I can easily find some of the more significant posts.
* I **am** a reddit user, and also an Arsenal fan. Reddit can be overwhelming & distracting sometimes; I'd like a shortcut to my favorite subreddit so I don't end up spending more time on the site/app than I plan to.



This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

### Existing Features:

1. **Homepage** - Acts as a streamlined [r/gunners](https://reddit.com/r/gunners). Contains embedded posts from reddit and an embedded widget with the entire subreddit.
2. **Homepage links** - Contains non-embedded links to other subreddits, and a link for non-users to sign up and join reddit.
3. **Fixtures page** - Contains a list of upcoming fixtures for the 20/21 season.
4. **Squad page** - Contains a list of players in the current squad.
5. **Official Footer** - Contains links to the clubs official channels (Website, Social media), as well as links to official merchandising.
6. **Our Friends page** - Contains links to other Arsenal fan projects, such as *AFTV* and *Arseblog*.

### Scrapped Features:

1. **Official page** - Contains links to the clubs official channels (Website, Social media), as well as links to official merchandising. Felt archaic; decided to replace it with a footer on every page which serves the same purpose.

### Features Left to Implement

* **News / Transfers** - In the future i'd like to implement a regularly updated news / transfers page.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML** - Used to structure my website
* **CSS** - Used to style/design my website

I used code from the following websites:

* **Reddit.com** - I embedded 6 posts directly from reddit.com/r/gunners
* **Redditjs.com** - I embedded a widget from Redditjs in order to have a mini version of r/gunners on my homepage.





### Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
